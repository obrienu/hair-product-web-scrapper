description= 'Essential 17 Hair Growth Oil is the first product Alikay Naturals introduced back in 2008 which Rochelle Graham (our CEO) created in her dorm room kitchen to address the natural hair concern of minimal growth. Today it is still in our Top 3 best-sellers because it works like nothing else! This customized and lightweight blend of 17 essential oils and herbs specifically promotes faster hair growth by nourishing the scalp while stimulating and strengthening the hair follicles. One of the first signs to know that Essential 17 is working is a reduction in dandruff and scalp irritation, which typically happens after the first week. It works amazing by itself or can be paired with Lemongrass Leave In Conditioner for the ultimate 1-2 punch! So, if you can't seem to get your hair past that shoulder-length natural growth hurdle, give Essential 17 a try and document your results to be featured in our next Growth Challenge!'

description= 'Think your hair is damaged beyond repair? Think again! Avocado Cream Moisture Repairing Hair Mask comes to the rescue by providing deep, much-needed nourishment to each individual hair strand from root to tip. Avocados contain beta-carotene, vitamins B, C, E and essential fats that provide vital nutrients needed for replenishing hair's strength, moisture, and shine. The result is moisturized hair that feels wonderfully soft and elastic with significantly reduced breakage. This means longer hair growth! Directions: Use on wet hair. Part hair into 2-4 sections, then finger comb to remove any tangles. Apply product evenly from root to tip, being sure to cover all of your hair. Cover with a plastic conditioning cap and let sit for 30 minutes. Rinse and style as usual. Note: This product can be used as a hair mask (before washing hair) or hair treatment (after washing hair). Hair Tip: For maximum moisturizing benefits, sit underneath a hooded dryer or hair steamer for 20 minutes with the hair mask on. To ensure proper shelf life, do not store in the shower where steam is collected! Safe for color treated hair'

Coconut milk was then added to help slow down hair loss and add a special touch of softness that cannot be replicated with synthetic ingredients. When combined with our Coconut Milk Shampoo, you now have a pH balanced combination that correctly lays the foundation for building a healthy hair care regimen!'

Ideal uses include: nurturing eyebrows and eyelashes, nourishing the hairline, taming flyaways, hydrating elbows, and conditioning cuticles. For Eyebrows - Place a small amount of the organic castor oil on a q-tip or mascara wand ( a little goes a long way ). Apply to only one eyebrow at a time. Start at the point of your eyebrow closest to the center of your face and apply the oil in the direction your eyebrow hairs naturally lay. Then, apply the oil in the opposite direction ensuring the eyebrow is saturated with the oil in both directions. For Eyelashes - Place a very small amount of castor oil on a mascara wand. Start at the base of your lashes and apply through the ends of your lashes. Be sure to only apply a small amount to avoid contact with your eyes. Precautions: Avoid contact with eyes. Do not ingest.

This customized and lightweight blend of 17 essential oils and herbs specifically promotes faster hair growth by nourishing the scalp while stimulating and strengthening the hair follicles. One of the first signs to know that Essential 17 is working is a reduction in dandruff and scalp irritation, which typically happens after the first week. It works amazing by itself or can be paired with Lemongrass Leave In Conditioner for the ultimate 1-2 punch! So, if you can't seem to get your hair past that shoulder-length natural growth hurdle, give Essential 17 a try and document your results to be featured in our next Growth Challenge!'

Part hair into 2-4 sections, then finger comb to remove any tangles. Apply product evenly from root to tip, being sure to cover all of your hair. Cover with a plastic conditioning cap and let sit for 30 minutes. Rinse and style as usual. Note: This product can be used as a hair mask (before washing hair) or hair treatment (after washing hair). Hair Tip: For maximum moisturizing benefits, sit underneath a hooded dryer or hair steamer for 20 minutes with the hair mask on. To ensure proper shelf life, do not store in the shower where steam is collected! Safe for color treated hair'

description= 'What It Does: This conditioner is infused with Briogeo's signature blend of ultra-nourishing rosehip, argan, and coconut oils to effectively restore the silky sheen to dry, brittle, lackluster locks. Coconut oil penetrates the hair shaft to nourish and repair from the inside out, sealing the uplifted cuticle to help lock in moisture and reduce environmental impurities. Argan oil provides extensive conditioning to restore luster and diminish frizz, while the antioxidant-rich rosehip oil helps shield strands from UV and free-radical damage. How To Use: After shampooing, dispense and apply evenly throughout hair length. Let sit for two minutes before rinsing. For best results, finish with Farewell Frizz Rosarco Milk Leave-In Conditioning Spray and/or Farewell Frizz Rosehip, Argan & Coconut Oil Blend prior to blow drying or using heat tools (sold separately). Precautions: Avoid contact with eyes. For external use only.'

description= 'Achieve your dream length with our Growth Bundle - featuring THREE bottles of the best-selling Essential 17 Hair Growth Oil This customized and lightweight blend of 17 essential oils and herbs specifically promotes faster hair growth by nourishing the scalp while stimulating and strengthening the hair follicles. One of the first signs to know that Essential 17 is working is a reduction in dandruff and scalp irritation, which typically happens after the first week. It works amazing by itself or can be paired with Lemongrass Leave In Conditioner for the ultimate 1-2 punch! Directions Shake well, then apply oil directly to scalp using the applicator tip. Massage into scalp well. Do not rinse out. Note: The brown speckles in the bottom is Horsetail Powder. Hair Tip: In general we recommend an every-other-night usage frequency, but encourage you to experiment to find your optimal frequency. It’s very important to massage the scalp when applying this product, as this increases scalp blood flow which causes the pores to open and absorb the essential oils.
